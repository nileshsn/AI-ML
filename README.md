# AI-ML

This repository contains my personal notes, code exercises, and projects from [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course). It's a hands-on learning journey covering fundamental machine learning concepts, with a focus on practical implementation using Python and TensorFlow.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

The MLCC offers a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, encompassing topics such as:

- **Linear Regression**: Understanding the relationship between variables and predicting continuous outcomes.
- **Logistic Regression**: Modeling binary classification problems.
- **Classification**: Techniques for categorizing data into discrete classes.
- **Data Preparation**: Handling numerical and categorical data, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Advanced Models**: Exploring neural networks, embeddings, and large language models.
- **Real-world ML**: Insights into production ML systems, automated machine learning, and fairness considerations.

Each topic includes interactive lessons, visualizations, and coding exercises to reinforce learning.
